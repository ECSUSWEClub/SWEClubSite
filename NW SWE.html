                    <h3>About me:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Natalie! I am a junior at Eastern and studying computer science. Previous to coming to Eastern, I studied at Simmons University in Boston, Massachusetts for 2 years. My favorite coding language is Python since it was also my first language I learned. After graduating, my dream job would be to work at a video game company to create games similar to the ones I adore!</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, I love to crochet, bake, sing, hangout with my family and friends, and play video games. My favorite games are The Sims, Animal Crossing, Cozy Grove, and Stardew Valley. I have a copious amount of animals at home that I share with my family but I have my own cat named Inky as well. He is a 2 year old American Shorthair Tuxedo Cat who loves getting in trouble.</p>
                    <p>I am currently working on adding coding projects to my resume and looking for internships!</p>
